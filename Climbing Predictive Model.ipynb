    "<h1> Climbing Ability Regression Model</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to compare and contrast various popular regression methods - DecisionTreeClassifier, AdaBoost, RandomForestClassifier and XGBoost. I will also be seeing how various processing techniques affect the performance of the models, such as methodologies to deal with NULL values, hyper parameter selection, sandbagging techniques etc. The goal is not to produce the most perfectly fine tuned model (or close to), but to test a range of methodologies used to create regression models and to develop some deeper understanding of their applied nuances. In addition, creating a code repository for different stages of this investigation (visualising decision trees, comparing different models, cross validation, hyper parameter tuning) will be valuable for future projects.\n",

    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> How to fit a simple decision tree, create a visualisation of it and draw top-line conclusions.</li>\n",
    "<li> Found a simple way to compare baseline models.</li>\n",
    "<li> Found out-of-the-box AdaBoost exemplified some of it's inherent flaws in smaller datasets, possibly overfitting to noise (especially noticeable in (high K) KFold cross validation on the smaller dataset).</li>\n",
    "<li> Dealing with NULL values on a larger dataset as opposed to a smaller, complete dataset decreased almost all of our model's variance by a considerable amount. </li>\n",
    "<li> ROC curves become exponentially more complicated to plot with in multi-class regression problems, making accuracy score the most easily attainable measure of model performance. During CV, using roc_auc as a performance metric was not possible. </li>\n",
    "<li> Precision/recall measurements in multi-class problems denote a single precision/recall per class predicted. The methodology remains the same to calculate precision (number of correctly predicted beginners out of all predicted beginners) and recall (of all actual beginners, how many predicted correctly).</li>\n",
    "<li> Wrote simple methodology to tune hyper-parameters using RandomizedGridSearchCV.</li>\n",
    "<li> Applied hash functions, created dummy variables and gained experience using a number of different data manipulation techniques in Python </li>\n",

    "Interesting and somewhat expected results. Speaking very generally over the decision tree, sponsored climbers, climbers with more logged climbs, longer time climbing and low(er) weight tended to climb higher grades. The number of years separator seemed to be much larger than anticipated, it seems younger climbers do not tend to log their climbs as much as older climbers. Another interesting find is that of climbers with many logged climbs who are not sponsored, those who were from Sweden tended to be classified as higher skilled, possibly speaking to their widespread climbing community and high standard of recreational climbers.\n",

    "The methodology used to deal with the NULLs affected each model similarly, with most models reducing in accuracy scores but also decreasing in variance. Given the large variance of the first iteration and the only small decrease in variance, this is clearly an overall positive outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further study to find the cause of the lower performance of the models will be performed, but some I assume a large portion of the findings are due to overcorrection of missing values. For a number of variables we replaced 30%+ of them with the mean of the other values. If we had a dataset with more features, likely these features would have been dropped altogether. \n",

    "A common AdaBoost criticism is that it is subject to noisy data and therefore has issues with high variance. While 10 iterations only produced one outlier, it still exemplifies this characteristic. Future projects with more suitable datasets will test to see if we can reduce AdaBoosts variance, or configure XGBoost to increase performance as this is an alleged advantage of XGBoost was that it introduces regularization parameters to reduce over fitting. \n",

The feature variables largely included physical attributes with no features referring at all to a climber’s perceived climbing skill or technical ability. If we saw the models perform better, it could be said that physical attributes play the largest role in the grades that can be achieved by the climber, however since they performed poorly this suggests that the climber's technical ability plays a significant role in addition."
